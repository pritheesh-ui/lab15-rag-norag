# This example demonstrates a simple "Needle in a Haystack" scenario, 
# where we have a large context of text (the "haystack") 
# and we want to see if the model can find a specific piece of information (the "needle") 
# when asked a question about it.
# For this, we need a large context to make it challenging for the model to find the relevant information,
# so we will use the full text of 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky as our haystack, 
# and we will inject a specific piece of information about a character named Denis, 
# who does not exist in rest of the book, as our needle.

# Warning: Rate Limits
# Be mindful of the number of requests you send to the API. 
# The size of the context and the number of tokens in the prompt may also affect your rate limit usage.

model_input_context_window_size_in_tokens = 10000 #  max input window size of the model in tokens. 
# This is not the same as the context window size in characters, which can be much larger. 
# The exact number of characters that fit into the token limit depends on the text,
# but a rough estimate is that 1 token is approximately 4 characters in English text. 
# So for a 100k token limit, you might expect around 400k characters, 
# but this can vary widely based on the content.
# Notice how we are using a much smaller context window size, in order to save tokens.
# For our test, the failure mode happens even if we do not fill in the entire context window anyway.

# Needle in a haystack Failure Demonstration
# The idea is to inject a specific piece of information inside a huge context of text, 
# and then ask a question to see if the model can find it or if it will hallucinate an answer.

# In this example, we will use the full text of 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky as the huge context,
# in which we will inject a specific piece of information about a character named Denis, who does not exist in rest of the book.
# We will then ask a question about a character named Denis and see if the model can retrieve the relevant information 
# about Denis from the sea of text, or if it will hallucinate an answer based on the general themes of the book 
# without actually finding the specific information about Denis.
